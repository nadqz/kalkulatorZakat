# Zakat Calculator
### By Streamlit Python

<li>
The Zakat Calculator is a calculator or mathematical tool designed to calculate the mandatory zakat that a Muslim is required to fulfill according to the Sharia provisions in Islam.
Zakat is a form of almsgiving or charitable giving in Islam. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which are the fundamental acts of worship and practice that all Muslims are expected to follow.
The calculator I created here is for zakat on expenditure or income, also known as professional zakat. It is a component of zakat maal that is obligatory to be paid on wealth derived from regular earnings or income from a job that is in accordance with Sharia principles.
