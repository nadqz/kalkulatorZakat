The calculator I created here is for zakat on expenditure or income, also known as professional zakat. It is a component of zakat maal that is obligatory to be paid on wealth derived from regular earnings or income from a job that is in accordance with Sharia principles.

The nisab for income zakat is 85 grams of gold per year. The income zakat rate is 2.5%. In practice, income zakat can be fulfilled monthly, with the monthly nisab value equivalent to one twelfth of 85 grams of gold, at a rate of 2.5%. Therefore, if the monthly income exceeds the monthly nisab value, it is mandatory to pay 2.5% of that income as zakat.
